Example: 
- 1: The left plots show the response versus the estimated effective dimension reduction directions (EDR-directions). The upper right plot is a three-dimensional plot of the first two directions and the response.  The lower right plot shows the eigenvalues (*) and the cumulative sum (o).
- 2: Plot of the true response versus the first true index. The monotonic and the convex shapes can be clearly seen.
- 3: Plot of the true response versus the second true index. The monotonic and the convex shapes can be clearly seen.
