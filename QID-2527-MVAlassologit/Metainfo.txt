Name of QuantLet: MVAlassologit

Published in: Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Description: 'Performs a logit model using the Lasso methodology. The estimates become nonzero at a point that means the variables enter the model equation sequentially as the shrinkage parameter increases. The Lasso technique results in variable selection. Finally, the resulting Lasso estimates and predictions are plotted.'

Keywords: estimation, lasso, lasso shrinkage, logistic, logit, regression, forecast, data visualization, plot, graphical representation, financial
